Thanks for download :)


Before using it, There are few more things that you have to set up before using, please follow the instructions in the manual as it is a required step. "AuterrainManual" (Path:"Assets/Auterrain/AuterrainManual.pdf")

I'm really sorry that I made this annoying process

This additional step is to set up a python environment that contains various libraries and trained model

I tried to remove this step by putting these additional files together to the asset store, but failed because of several errors

How to set up and how to use this program is all summarized in the manual 

Manual is also available on my blog: https://blog.naver.com/kanrhaehfdl1/221796163468

Also prepared as a simple video: https://youtu.be/Lrs4pRvHcB4

I tried to make manual as easy and detailed as possible, but there could be some problems

So, if you have any problems, plz mail me here: kanrhaehfdl1@naver.com
